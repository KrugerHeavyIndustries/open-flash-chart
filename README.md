= Gemified version of open_flash_chart

This library is a gemified version of open_flash_chart that was originally packaged with Potion Store. Since there is an effort to bring Potion Store up to more modern standards this dependency was extracted to a ruby gem for cleanliness until a suitable modern replacement can be found. It probably has no long term future.

== open_flash_chart

This library was ported from the open flash chart project's php code to be used with Ruby on Rails.
